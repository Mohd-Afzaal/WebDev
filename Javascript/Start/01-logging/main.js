// logging is different from print
// logging is more for professional debugging and stuffs
// it is the act of recording things during execution


console.log("Hello Aish");

var first = "hallo";
console.log(first);

// u can use commas for multiple variables logging
// no worries space will be added in places of commas
var a = "yes";
var b = "no";
console.log("first:",a,"Second:",b);

// u can use placeholders for variables
// different types of variables have different placeholders

console.log("%s, %s ",a,b);
